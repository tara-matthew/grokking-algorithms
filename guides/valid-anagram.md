* If the lengths of the two string aren't the same, return false
* Make an empty hashmap/map for the counts
* Loop through the first string, and add the counts for each character
* Loop through the second string, if the character doesn't exist in the counts map, return false
* Loop through the second string, and decrement the counts for each character
* If we manage to reach the end of the loop, return true
