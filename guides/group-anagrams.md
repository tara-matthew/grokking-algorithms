* Make an empty hashmap
* Loop through the strings
* Make an array with 26 0s
* Loop through the characters of each string, and convert the ascii code of each character into a number between 0 and 26
* Increment the counts of each integer in the array to match these codes
* Write to the hashmap, with the key as the character code combinations in the array, and the value as the string
* Any words with equivalent keys are set as the value
